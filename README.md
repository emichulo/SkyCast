It's a nice multithreading server-client weather app with an API for weather informations.


This is my last project for university I don't think you can get some informations because the API expired in this years but it's a very good template for a multithreading server-client app. Also have 2 types of clients (inet and unix) and also a windows client in python that connects to the server even if the server is in c (linux). Also the the server have some constrains, the admin client (the unix one) can have a connection 1:1 with the server that means only one admin can connect to the server. If we talk about the client have a connection 1:n that means that n clients can connect to the server. As I said it's a good template for a multithreading server-client app and also for communication between server and client and vice versa.
